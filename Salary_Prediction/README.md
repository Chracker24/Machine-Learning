# Salary Prediction Project
## Introduction
This project showcases my first dive into Machine Learning starting with Linear Regression. 
This project contains a ML program [Machine1.py](https://github.com/Chracker24/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Salary_Prediction/src/Machine1.py) that imports functions from [functions.py](https://github.com/Chracker24/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Salary_Prediction/src/functions.py) that learns from a data file called "Salary_Data.csv" that contains Years of Experience and corresponding Salaries. And learns to predict Salary when a specific amount of Years of Experience is inputted by the user
