## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as my personal playground for exploring, experimenting, and implementing various Machine Learning algorithms and projects.  
From basic models to more complex experiments, this is where I document my learning journey, test new ideas, and build a portfolio of real-world applications as I grow in the field of AI and ML.

Whether it’s for sharpening concepts, revisiting fundamentals, or preparing for internships and research roles — this repo is the brain dump of my ML grind.
